# corrupt download cannot get here, but a full disk mid-unpack can. /bin/sh is
# bash in org.freedesktop.Platform; the subshell probe keeps this a no-op rather
# than a hard failure on a shell without pipefail.

# Runs offline at install time inside org.freedesktop.Platform. Upstream ships
# CodeBuddy CN as a plain FHS .deb built from Code-OSS: the whole Electron
# application tree lives under /usr/share/buddycn (Chromium, the VS Code-derived
# app resources with their node-pty / sqlite3 / @parcel/watcher native modules,
# the bundled extensions and the `buddycn` CLI under bin/), plus a desktop
# entry, an icon and a couple of system files. Keep the application directory at
# /app/extra/codebuddy, the stable path the wrapper execs.
#
# Not staged: etc/apparmor.d and etc/sysctl.d, which configure the host's
# unprivileged-userns policy for Chromium's own sandbox — inside Flatpak that
# job belongs to zypak. The desktop files, icon, MIME definition and AppStream
# metainfo are shipped by the manifest at *build* time, because extra-data is
# fetched later on the user's machine and anything Flatpak must export cannot
# come from here.
