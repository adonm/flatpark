# Update resolver for CodeBuddy CN.

# Prints the current version + the Linux x86_64 .deb as JSON on stdout:
#   { "version": "4.11.3.37298507-2345dde1-cn", "releaseDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
#     "sources": [ { "filename": "codebuddy-amd64.deb", "url": "..." } ] }
# Logs go to stderr. No hashing, no manifest rewriting — FlatPark downloads the
# URL and computes the extra-data sha256/size at build time. The version is
# compared against the latest <release> in the AppStream metainfo.
#
# Upstream publishes a per-platform manifest at aiide/version.json; the Linux
# x86_64 build's stable channel carries the full version string, and the .deb
# filename is that string verbatim. The version keeps its build number and
# commit hash because upstream re-cuts a release under the same 4.x.y with a new
# hash — a trimmed "4.11.3" would never re-pin.
